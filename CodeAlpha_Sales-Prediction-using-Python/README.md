CodeAlpha – Data Science Internship : Sales Price Prediction using Python

# 1. Project Overview:

This project predicts sales using both regression models and time-series forecasting models.
It was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship .

The project includes:

- Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Time-Series Models- ARIMA and Prophet
- Visualizations and evaluation metrics

# 2. Dataset: 
given in the instruction manual from CodeAlpha (Advertising.csv)

Column- Description
1. TV-  TV advertising spend
2. Radio- Radio advertising spend
3. Newspaper- Newspaper advertising spend
4. Sales- Sales generated (target variable)



# 3. Models Used:
1. Regression Models : Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor
2. Time-Series Models: ARIMA, Prophet	

Visualizations Included

- Correlation Heatmap
- Regression: Actual vs Predicted
- ARIMA Forecast Plot
- Prophet Forecast Plot


# 4. Evaluation Metrics:

a. Regression: 
  1. Linear Regression: mae- 0.8994, R² Score- 0.461
  2. Random Forest Regressor: mae- 0.62871, rmse: 0.757 R² Score- 0.982
  3. Gradient Boosting Regressor: mae- 0.618, rmse: 0.7297 R² Score- 0.98312

# 5. Key Insights:

- TV advertising strongly influences sales
- Random Forest & Gradient Boosting outperform Linear Regression
- Prophet performs better for long-term forecasting than ARIMA
- Sales show a clear positive trend with ad spend

# 6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of multiple ML models and time-series forecasting techniques for predicting sales.
It offers valuable insights that businesses can use for marketing strategy and budget optimization.
