# CodeAlpha_Iris-Flower-Classification

# 1. Overview:
This project is developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.  
The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** using a Machine Learning model. based on it's : sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width from given dataset


# 2. Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python.
- Pandas.
- Scikit-learn.
- RandomForestClassifier.


# 3. Dataset:
 1. Source: given in the instruction manual (iris.csv)
 2. Description: The dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers with 4 numeric features and 1 categorical label (species).
 3. Feature Description : 

     -SepalLengthCm-  Sepal length in cm 
     -SepalWidthCm- Sepal width in cm 
     -PetalLengthCm- Petal length in cm 
     -PetalWidthCm- Petal width in cm 
     -Species- Type of Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) 

# 4. Project Workflow:

   1. Data Loading & Exploration- Loaded the Iris dataset and explored its structure
   2. Data Preprocessing- Encoded species labels into numeric form. (0,1,2)
   3. Train-Test Split- Divided dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
   4. Model Building- Trained a RandomForestClassifier model on the training data.
   5. Evaluation- Evaluated accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
   6. Prediction- Tested model with a new unseen flower sample.


# 5. Results:
- Accuracy: ~99%
- The model effectively classifies all three species of Iris flowers with near-perfect performance.


# 6. Learnings:
  1. Basics of data preprocessing and encoding
  2. Splitting data into training and testing sets
  3. Training and evaluating classification models
  4. Understanding classification metrics
